        <h1>A city's heartbeat, visualized</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Data tells the story</p>
        <p>I wanted to share a little project I've been working on recently. I've been diving into Portland's 311 request data (Maine not Oregon), trying to get a feel for the city's pulse.</p>
<p>It's pretty amazing what you can learn from everyday data. Each request is like a little whisper, telling its own small part of a bigger story.</p>
<p>I put together this dashboard to help make sense of it all. Check it out:</p>
<div style="text-align:left;">
  <a href="https://ehringhaus.shinyapps.io/project/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <img src="city.jpg" alt="Pulse of Portland Dashboard" style="max-width:44%; height:auto;">
  </a>
  <p style="color:grey; font-size:small;">Pulse of Portland Dashboard</p>
</div>

<p>It's nothing fancy, but I think it's a neat way to glimpse into the life of the city and the experiences of the people living there.</p>
<p>What's particularly cool was trying out the gpt-3.5 turbo API to generate recommendations based on the data. Perhaps cities might be run this way in the future, with AI sorting through data and helping to guide decisions.</p>
<p>But honestly, the best part has been just exploring the data and seeing what emerges. Anyway, I don't want to ramble on. Let me know what you think!</p>
