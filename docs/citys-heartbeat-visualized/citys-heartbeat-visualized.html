        <h1>A city's heartbeat, visualized</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Data tells the story</p>
        <p>I wanted to share a little project I've been working on recently. I've been diving into Portland's 311 request data, trying to get a feel for the city's pulse.</p>
<p>It's pretty amazing what you can learn from this kind of everyday data. Each request is like a little whisper from the city, telling its own small part of a bigger story.</p>
<p>I put together this dashboard to help make sense of it all. Check it out:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <a href="https://ehringhaus.shinyapps.io/project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <img src="city.jpg" alt="Pulse of Portland Dashboard" style="max-width:66%; height:auto;">
  </a>
  <p style="color:grey; font-size:small;">Pulse of Portland Dashboard</p>
</div>

<p>It's nothing too fancy, but I think it's a neat way to get a glimpse into the life of the city and the experiences of the people living here.</p>
<p>What's really cool is that I was able to use some AI to generate recommendations based on the data. It's like a sneak peek into how cities might be run in the future, with data and AI helping to guide decisions.</p>
<p>But honestly, the best part for me has been just exploring the data and seeing what stories emerge. It's reminded me of how much we can learn by being curious and diving into the details of everyday life.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't want to ramble on. Let me know what you think!</p>
