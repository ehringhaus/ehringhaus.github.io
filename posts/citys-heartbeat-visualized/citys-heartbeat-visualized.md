I wanted to share a little project I've been working on recently. I've been diving into Portland's 311 request data (Maine not Oregon), trying to get a feel for the city's pulse.

It's pretty amazing what you can learn from everyday data. Each request is like a little whisper, telling its own small part of a bigger story.

I put together this dashboard to help make sense of it all. Check it out:

<div style="text-align:left;">
  <a href="https://ehringhaus.shinyapps.io/project/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <img src="city.jpg" alt="Pulse of Portland Dashboard" style="max-width:44%; height:auto;">
  </a>
  <p style="color:grey; font-size:small;">Pulse of Portland Dashboard</p>
</div>

It's nothing fancy, but I think it's a neat way to glimpse into the life of the city and the experiences of the people living there.

What's particularly cool was trying out the gpt-3.5 turbo API to generate recommendations based on the data. Perhaps cities might be run this way in the future, with AI sorting through data and helping to guide decisions.

But honestly, the best part has been just exploring the data and seeing what emerges. Anyway, I don't want to ramble on. Let me know what you think!
